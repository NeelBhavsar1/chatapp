# React Firebase Chat App

- Real-time chat messaging powered by Firebase Firestore
- Firestore security rules to protect user data and restrict access to authenticated users
- Fast development and optimized build using Vite

## How It Works
The app leverages Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), providing authentication, real-time database, and hosting capabilities without the need for custom backend code. Users can sign up and sign in, send messages, and see new messages appear instantly in the chat room thanks to Firestoreâ€™s real-time synchronization.
