The app leverages Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), providing authentication, real-time database, and hosting capabilities without the need for custom backend code. Users can sign up and sign in, send messages, and see new messages appear instantly in the chat room thanks to Firestoreâ€™s real-time synchronization.
